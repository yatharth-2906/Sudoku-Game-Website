# Introduction
In this report, we present the detailed development and implementation of Simple Sudoku Game. The Sudoku game consists of Graphical User Interface, solver and puzzle generator; implemented using HTML, CSS, JAVA_SCRIPT and CPP. The solver and generator is implemented using Application Program Interface. The solver finds the solution to the puzzles generated.This project gives an insight in to the different aspects of CPP Programming and Web Development.


# Algorithm
![# Backtracking Algorithm](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/BackTracking%20Algorithm%20-%20Soni/state-space-tree-in-backtracking-algorithm.png)
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique whose goal is to use brute force to find all solutions to a problem. It entails gradually compiling a set of all possible solutions. Because a problem will have constraints, solutions that do not meet them will be removed.

## Write a sudoku solver in JavaScript using backtracking algorithms

**Now we will need several functions to :**

 - Convert Html Table to JS array
 - Check input integer [1-9]
 - Find the next empty position
 - Check a value in a row
 - Check a value in a column
 - Check a value in a 9 squared box
 - Find The Solution
 - Reset inputs.
